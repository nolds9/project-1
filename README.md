# Project 1
## War
#### Gameplay
This is my take on the classic, 2-player card game "War." It's a game in which a shuffled deck is dealt evenly to both players. The players then compare their top cards. The player with the highest card value will take both cards.


#### Technologies Used
For this project I used HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript.

## Goals for this project

### Bronze Level Goal
- The game should be able to determine the highest card played
- The game should add the two played cards to the winner's hand
- There should be a button that compares the top card from each player's hand when pressed
- The game should alert that the game is over when one player is out of cards

### Silver Level Goal
- Some DOM manipulation
  * DIVs to represent "flipped cards" (not necessarily styled)
- Reset button
- DIVs to represent each player's hand (not necessarily styled)
- If there is a tie each player keeps the card they played
  * (I ended up scrapping this idea because of the eventual "war on tie" functionality)

### Gold Level Goal
- Styled cards for players hands and for the flipped cards
- Play "War" if the players tie
  * Play "War" again if the war ends in a tie (continue this until there is a winner)
- Notification when someone wins
- Support for multiple players
- Visuals for "War"
