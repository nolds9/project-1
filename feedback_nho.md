### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations** It looks like you mapped out your scope early, came up with great user stories, and planned your bronze, silver, and gold versions, and went to working evolving your MVP - well done! As we start working on larger applications in the future, it would be nice to include more evidence of your planning process, such as wireframes, ERD's, a Trello board, etc.

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations** Congratulations, your project demonstrates prolific use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! Leaning toward "Exceeds" here because your pushed yourself to address the fringe-case complexities in War.

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations** Nice and clean! Code was well-structured (yay objects!) and included great code comments. Please review my inline code comments [here](https://github.com/pkmoran/project-1/compare/gh-pages...nolds9:feedback) (prefixed with my initials - "NHO") for feedback.

* __Problem Solving__:

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations** Excellent job getting a jumpstart on this project, and constantly challenging yourself to build upon your work, while also staying true to your original scope. I really liked how you it looks like you had fun with this project and encourage you to continuing working on this to implement any wish-list features in the future!
